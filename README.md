# ImageStacker
Lazy image stacking experiment.


This does very little at the moment. Finds a center-of-mass for each image (given a minimum threshold), centers the image, then stacks them using a simple mean value. Depending on how much I tinker with it, maybe it'll get tiepoints, autopointing, actual stacking algorithms, and other analysis. Works best for planetary bodies where the entire disk is contained within the viewport.
